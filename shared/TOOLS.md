# Open-Source Security Tools for GenAI Systems

A curated, practitioner-oriented reference of open-source and freely
available tools for securing LLM applications, agentic systems, and
GenAI data pipelines. Every tool listed here is referenced in one or
more crosswalk mapping files in this repository.

Tools are organised by function. Each entry includes a brief
description of what it does, what risks it addresses (mapped to
OWASP source list entries), and a link. Commercial tools are listed
only where no open-source equivalent exists for a critical function.

This file is a living reference — contributions welcome via PR.
See CONTRIBUTING.md for the tool addition template.
